This repo is meant to demonstrate how to setup a serverless web application using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa). It creates a simple web application with a database and is meant to be a starting point for more complex projects.

A demo of the deployed code (deployed using Zappa) can be found [here](https://auakxywz61.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/).

Quickstart
----------

This is a work in progress... Getting everything setup first and then I will update the readme file here.
